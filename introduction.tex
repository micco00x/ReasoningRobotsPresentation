\begin{frame}{Introduction}
	\begin{block}{}
    The main goal of the project is to train an agent acting on a non-Markovian reward decision process (NMRDP) environment.
	\end{block}

    \begin{block}{}
    Rewards are define through $\text{LTL}_f$/$\text{LDL}_f$ formulas, defining complex behaviour made up of multiple steps over time.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{}
    The learning is done using classical reinforcement learning algorithm working on MDP environments.
