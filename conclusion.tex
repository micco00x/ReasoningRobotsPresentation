\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item The presented project is an extension of the previous project on the Atari Environment
	\item The best performance did not manage to correctly solve the Atari Breakout game
	\item Fundamental problems have been identified, in particular non-determinism, in the environment
	\item Thoose problems prevent algorithms such as Q-Learning or SARSA from achiving satisfactory results
	\item Future work must be done to solve such problems, especially the introduction of a neural network
    \end{itemize}
